# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Pygame. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode (Player 1 and Player 2)
- Visual representation of the grid and marks using Pygame
- Displays the winner or a draw message at the end of the game
- Simple and intuitive mouse click-based controls

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nerkyzas157/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
```
2. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

1. Run the tic_tac_toe.py script.

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

2. The game window will open, showing the Tic Tac Toe grid.

3. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns clicking on the grid to place their mark.

4. The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player aligns three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), a winning message will be displayed.

5. If all spots on the grid are filled without a winner, the game will declare a draw.

6. The game window will close automatically after displaying the winner or draw message.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a restart button to start a new game without closing the window.
- Implement a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
- Add welcome screen.
- Add [Super Tic-Tac-Toe mode](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_Na3a1ZrX7c)
